## About project
I've been wanting to try something like this for a whileâ€”creating an app with base classes. It's been such a cool experience, and I'm really glad I gave it a shot! <3

I tried to build an app with a structure kinda similar to Django, starting by creating a base model and inheriting it to make a book model. I also set up commands, which are basically like views in Django. I even attempted to make a mini Django-like ORM, so interacting with the models would be smoother. The goal was to make CRUD operations universal, so every model could work with them without needing to redefine those methods in each model. ðŸš€

All in all, itâ€™s been a fun challenge! ðŸ˜Ž
